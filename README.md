QuickTag
========

QuickTag For iTunes is a companion application for iTunes. QuickTag allows a user to quickly click through tracks in 
their music library, and click off custom tags which can then be written to the ID3 tags of the tracks.

These meta-data tags are added with uniquely identifiable delimiters, such that the user can later use iTunes
smart-playlist feature to easily filter tracks based on the meta-data tags.

For example, a customized genres is added as: (Genre), to the ID3 Genre field.
Additional tags supported by the program are added to the ID3 Comments field, for example: {House Music},[Light Vocal]

The application is written in AppleScriptOBJC for Mac OS X (other operating systems are not supported as 
AppleScript is required).
