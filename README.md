### About
QuickTag for iTunes was developed to solve a problem frequently encoutered by DJ's trying to organize large music collections.  Although originally intended for DJ's, QuickTag can be used for anyone with a large music collection wanting to better sort their music.

QuickTag runs along side iTunes.  It allows you to configure a list of custom track genres, categories, and attributes.  When a track is played in iTunes, it's display in QuickTag, and you can quickly tick off the new genre, a rating, a category and any number of your configured attributes.  

After clicking "Apply", the tracks ID3 genre tag is updated with the new genre, and all of the additional fields are written to the ID3 comments field.  The tags are written in such a way that you can then utilize iTunes smart-playlist feature to search for, sort and organize your tracks however you like.
