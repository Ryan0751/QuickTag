QuickTag
========

QuickTag For iTunes is a companion application for iTunes which allows a user to quickly click through tracks in 
their music library and click off custom meta-data tags which can then be written to the ID3 tags of the tracks.

These meta-data tags are added with uniquely identifiable delimiters, such that the user can later use iTunes
smart-playlist feature to easily filter tracks based on the meta-data tags.

The application is written in AppleScriptOBJC for Mac OS X (other operating systems are not supported as 
AppleScript is required).
