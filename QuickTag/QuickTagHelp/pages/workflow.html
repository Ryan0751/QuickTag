				<h1>QuickTag  Overview</h1>
			</div>
				<p>QuickTag is a companion application for iTunes which allows extra meta-data tags 
                                   to be added to an iTunes track collection.</p> 
                                <p>Written initially for DJ's (but adapatable to any large music collection), QuickTag
                                   provides a consistent system for adding additional tags that are easy to use in iTunes 
                                   smart playlists.  
                                <p>For DJ's, the typical "Genre" tag is often not descriptive 
                                   enough to allow a large collection of music to be easily sortable and 
                                   searchable.  QuickTag allows custom genres, categories and attributes to be defined which can 
                                   quickly be checked off and added to the tags for each track, eliminating the manual 
                                   process of editing tags.</p>
                                <p>QuickTag uses the "Genre" and one other (comments, grouping, collection) ID3 tag fields in order to write the custom
                                   tag values.  The custom tags are added with unique delimiters for each type, allowing 
                                   smart-playlists to accurately search for tag values without matching other values 
                                   present in the tags.</p>
                                <p>QuickTag also allows you to specify the 1 to 5-star rating for each track.  Normally,
                                   the rating value is only stored in iTunes internal format, QuickTag writes the rating 
                                   value as an additional custom tag, so that if tracks are moved out of iTunes the ratings
                                   will follow the track.</p>
                                <p>QuickTag should work on any audio format supported in iTunes.  Only audio formats with 
                                   ID3 support (MP3, AIFF), will allow you to move tracks out of iTunes and retain the 
                                   tag values, however.</p>
				<div id="taskbox">
                                <p>A typical workflow is as follows:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define custom genres, categories and attributes in the QuickTag preferences.
						<li>Play tracks in iTunes.  For each track, select a new genre, rating and category, 
                                                    along with any number of attributes.  Apply the changes.
                                                <li>After tagging tracks, build iTunes smart playlists to properly organize 
                                                    and sort your music.
